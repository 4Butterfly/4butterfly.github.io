Backed with the support of certified coders, EMP Claims makes use of the latest coding – including CPT, ICD-9, and HCPCS codes – such that the number of claims accepted is maximized and delays in reimbursements are significantly reduced. That’s not all. Once the claims are submitted, EMP Claims team aggressively follows up on these claims to ensure they are completed quickly such that reimbursements are optimized. For example, EMP Claims team ensures that:



The claims have been accepted with insurance carriers and/or the clearinghouse

The status of claims with insurance carriers is checked

Past-due accounts of self-pay patients are collected

Claims are resubmitted to insurance carriers

Clients are notified of the “incomplete claims” which could not be processed, or for additional information as required by the insurance carrier

Unpaid procedures are tracked and Letters of Medical Necessity are sent



Your extended team of medical billing professionals at EMP Claims follows through till the process is complete with sending patient statements, posting payments, and providing detailed reports.



EMP Claims generates monthly statements that include the remaining balance after the insurance carrier has made the payment, as well as if balance billing is permitted in the provider's agreement with them. In addition, a monthly statement to uninsured or self-pay patients, who did not pay at the time of service, is also generated. This can also include patients on a payment plan.



Payments for both insurance claims and self-pay patient accounts are posted and EMP Claims encourages all its clients to establish a merchant account. This is with a view that when patients have the ability to pay using alterative payment methods such as cash, check, credit card, or special payment plans, the odds of receiving immediate reimbursement are greatly increased.



EMP Claims generates monthly progress reports that account for the status of every claim. These monthly reports include details such as:

Claims submitted

Accounts receivable aging

Practice analysis

Unable to bill out report (list of patients who require attention and/or additional information)
